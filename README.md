This project is the first serious one I've ever worked on, so it surely needs some polishing. For any inconveniences I merely can apologise.

MeteoData is a project aiming to allow for highly configurable and open source weather simulations on any data given.
As long as the input is in a form of a 2D (and perhaps in the future even a 3D) map of some physical quality of the atmosphere, 
it will be valuable. 

The project consists of several stages:
  -  rainfall movement tracking
  -  pressure variance simulation, along with temperature changes simulation
  -  wind simulation using the available and computed data
  -  extending data size to global scale
  -  improving on performance and quality
  -  creating a more structured and friendly UI, to allow for various datasets to be used

As of now (06.09.24. 7:06AM UTC+1) the project is closing in on the first stage.
